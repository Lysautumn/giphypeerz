# GIPHY Refactor

This program is a refactor of the GIPHY search code I did previously. This refactor was to practice using services. All the API calls have been moved into a service. This frees up the controller code to only contain things that are specific to running the controller. This refactor also updates the file structure into one that is more readable.

## Features

This program still contains the ability to click a button and get a random gif using Giphy's API. It also has a search bar that allows a user to search for gifs and get results from Giphy.
